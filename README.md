# Access_control

This interesting implementation helps to allocate roles, i.e. there is some kind of super Admin who can allocate roles to any addresses and give them appropriate rights, for example to be a "withdrawer", and he (super Admin) can also make someone else a super Admin, and this person can also allocate roles.
